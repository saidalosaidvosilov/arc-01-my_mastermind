# Welcome to My Mastermind
Version: 1.0.0

## Task
Mastermind is a code-breaking game in which the computer generates a secret code of four colors, and the player tries to guess it by entering four guesses. The computer then provides feedback on each guess, indicating the number of colors that are correct and in the correct position (called "bulls"), and the number of colors that are correct but in the wrong position (called "cows"). The player wins the game by guessing the secret code in the fewest number of guesses.
The challenge in this project is to implement the logic of the Mastermind game in Python. This includes generating the secret code, providing feedback on guesses, and keeping track of the number of guesses remaining.
## Description
This project implements the Mastermind game in Python. The computer generates a random secret code of four colors from a set of six colors: red, green, yellow, blue, purple, and cyan. The player then enters four guesses, one at a time. The computer provides feedback on each guess, indicating the number of colors that are correct and in the correct position (called "bulls"), and the number of colors that are correct but in the wrong position (called "cows"). The player wins the game by guessing the secret code in the fewest number of guesses
## Installation
To install the project, you will need Python 3.6 or higher. You can install the project by running the following command in your terminal:
## Usage
The game will then start and you will be prompted to enter your first guess. Once you have entered your guess, the computer will provide feedback. Continue entering guesses until you guess the secret code. The game will keep track of the number of guesses you have made and the time it took you to win.```
### The Core Team
I complete this project with my coding mentor!
